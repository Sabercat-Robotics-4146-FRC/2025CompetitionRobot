# Az-RBSI
Arizona's Reference Build and Software Implementation for FRC Robots (read: "A-Z-ribsy")


## Installation

Installation instructions are found in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.  See
the [Releases Page](https://github.com/AZ-First/Az-RBSI/releases) for details
on the latest release, including restrictions and cautions.


## Purpose

The purpose of Az-RBSI is to help Arizona FRC teams with:
* Improving robot reliability / performance during “Autonomous Play”
* Improving robot build & endurance, gameplay reliability and troubleshooting
    skills
* Providing a standardized robot “stack” to allow for quick software setup and
    troubleshooting, and make it easier for Arizona teams to form effective
    in-state alliances


## Design Philosophy

The Az-RBSI is centered around a "Reference Build" robot that allows for teams
to communicate quickly and effectivly with each other about gameplay strategy
and troubleshooting.  Additionally, the consolidation around a standard robot
design allows for easier swapping of spare parts and programming modules.

The Az-RBSI software is an outline of an FRC robot program upon which teams can
build with their particular mechanisms and designs.  It weaves together popular
and currently maintained FIRST- and community-sponsored software libraries to
provide a baseline robot functionality that combines robust reliability with
effective logging for troubleshooting.
