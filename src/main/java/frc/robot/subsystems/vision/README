This directory contains an the basic vision template, as distributed with
AdvantageKit.  The structure of the subsystem directory is:

    * Vision.java
        The base subsystem definitions and outward-facing (public) hardware-
        agnostic functions for interacting with the subsystem.  The idea is
        that any of the hardware-specific (i.e. camera system API calls)
        functionality is insulated from the rest of the robot code within
        the library-specific modules in this directory.
    
    * VisionIO.java
        The base subsystem I/O (input/output) interface that contains the
        structure and class variables needed by the library-specific modules.
    
    * VisionIOLimelight.java
        The vision implementation for the Limelight camera system, which maps
        Limelight-specific API calls back onto the generic vision API defined
        above.

    * VisionIOPhotonVision.java
        The vision implementation for the Photon Vision camera system, which
        maps PhotonLib-specific API calls back onto the generic vision API
        defined above.

    * VisionIOPhotonVisionSim.java
        Simulated vision module, for use with robot simulations, does not
        control actual hardware.
