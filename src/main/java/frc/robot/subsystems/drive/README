The hardware-specific IO files included here are a baseline for what we expect
teams to use.  If, however, you are using a different combination of hardware,
you will need to create a new ``ModuleIO*.java`` or ``GyroIO*.java`` file.  We
encourage you to submit a PR to the Az-RBSI repositiory with your new hardware
file if you feel other teams may benefit from its inclusion.  Additionally, the
instantiation logic in ``Drive.java`` will need to be extended to include the
new module type.

Existing IO files:

  - ``GyroIOPigeon2.java``: CTRE Pigeon2 as the swerve IMU
  - ``GyroIONavX.java``: NavX as the swerve IMU, connected via SPI

  - ``ModuleIOTalonFX.java``: 2x TalonFX motors + CANcoder
  - ``ModuleIOSpark.java``: 2x Rev NEO motors + analog absolute encoder connected to the RIO
  - ``ModuleIOSparkCANcoder.java``: 2x Rv NEO motors + CANcoder
  - ``ModuleIOBlended.java``: TalonFX drive, Rev NEO steer motors + CANcoder
