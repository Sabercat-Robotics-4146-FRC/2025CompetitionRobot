Az-RBSI -- Java Root Directory

--------------------
This directory contains the basic Java files needed to define and run an FRC
robot.  The files that should exist in this directory are listed below, along
with a brief description of their contents and which files MUST be edited to
include information about the specific robot being controlled.

BuildConstants.java
    Not tracked by git, used by the build system to record information about
    the latest build of the code.  This file should NOT be altered, and will be
    overwritten each time the code is built / compiled.

Constants.java
    A file for enumerating physical and software constants for the robot.  The
    main Constants class should contain subsystem-specific classes that list
    the constants for each subsystem.  This is useful for organization and
    importing only the constants needed for a particular software module.  This
    file MUST be modified to include the proper robot constants in the code.

Main.java
    This is the file run by the RoboRIO virtual machine.  Do NOT alter this
    file.

Robot.java
    This file is called by ``Main.java`` and directs the operation of the robot
    according to the currently commanded mode (disabled, autonomous, teleop,
    test, and simulation).  Care must be taken when modifying this module to
    ensure proper operation of the robot.  One section that would be useful to
    modify is the test mode, where teams can implement pre-match systems
    testing in a known sequence.

RobotContainer.java
    A file for holding robot subsystems and commands.  This file is called
    from ``Robot.java`` and is where all subsystems and commands should be
    gathered and organized including button bindings for operator controls,
    CANbus and DIO port enumeration for robot devices, and camera pose
    information (with respect to robot center).


--------------------
Subdirectories:

commands/
    Commands build in separate modules (rather than in subsystem definitions or
    inline commands in ``RobotContainer.java``) live in this directory.
    Organization of files and subdirectories herein is left to the discrection
    of teams.

generated/
    This directory holds the ``TunerConstants.java`` file produced by Phoenix
    Tuner X's swerve generator  (you must generate this file for your specific
    drivetrain -- the one included in the Az-RBSI is an example only).  It must
    be modified as described in the AdvantageKit documentation (removal of
    final function and final import; modification of ``kSteerInertia`` and
    ``kDriveInertia`` constants to be ``0.004`` and ``0.025``, respectively;
    optional "Pro" feature, set ``kSteerClosedLoopOutput`` and/or
    ``kDriveClosedLoopOutput`` to  ``ClosedLoopOutputType.TorqueCurrentFOC``;
    characterize the drive and turn feedforward gains [``kS``,``kV``,``kA``]
    using the auto routines included in the Az-RBSI).

subsystems/
    The hardware definition of subsystems is done in this directory.
    Organization of files and subdirectories herein is left to the discrection
    of teams.

util/
    Various utility functions used by the Az-RBSI are included in this
    directory.  Most teams will not need to modify these routines, but
    additional utilities deemed necessary by individual teams may be placed
    here for organizational purposes.  The EXCEPTION is
    ``OverrideSwitches.java``, which may be modified to meet the specific
    design requirements of teams.  ``OverrideSwitches.java`` can be modified
    to match any manual override switches on an operator console as described
    in that module.
